            <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
            <p>
                At GOA (Goal-Oriented Academy), we're not just teaching kids how to code — we're helping them discover who they are and what they're capable of. Our focus is on growth, creativity, and building a mindset that thrives on curiosity and challenge.
                We believe kids don’t need to be forced to learn — they just need the right environment. One where they're supported, encouraged, and allowed to fail forward. Our community is built on mutual respect, positive energy, and the idea that everyone grows at their own pace. There’s no pressure to be perfect here — only a push to be better than you were yesterday.
                We’re here for the kids who are full of questions, the ones who love to explore, and even the ones who can’t sit still. We take their energy and help turn it into something powerful — skills they’ll use for life, and confidence that lasts.
                More than anything, we care about creating a space where learning feels exciting and becoming your best self feels possible.

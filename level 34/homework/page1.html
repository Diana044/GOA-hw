        <p>Causes of World War I</p>
        <p>The immediate cause of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo. This event triggered a series of alliances and conflicts. However, underlying causes included:<p>
        <ol>
            <li>Militarism – Nations built up massive militaries, leading to an arms race.</li>
            <li>Alliances – Entangling alliances pulled many countries into conflict.</li>
            <li>Imperialism – Competition for colonies heightened tensions.</li>
            <li>Nationalism – Ethnic groups sought independence or dominance, particularly in the Balkans. </li>
        </ol>

    <h1>1957 Chevrolet Bel Air Convertible in Dawsonville, Georgia</h1>
    <h2>Vehicle Description</h2>
    <p>Airspace Turquoise bathes the straight panels of this car which are minding their gaps. Dual rockets push forward and leave their rounded metal trail on the hood, flying forward to the gold egg crate grille surrounded by a large smile of chrome trimming above and below a big bumper with mini rubber covered “dagmars” and a central cloisonné badge. Just above is a gold wide V with Chevrolet badge written in your grandmother's handwriting and flanking on either side is a single shiny bezeled headlight. On the sides more gold accenting with 3 small vertical bars topping a stainless trim spear which runs rearward past the doors and then opens up into the white and shiny stainless rear quarter trim. More bling is on top of the fins created by the end of the roofline and running towards the vertical chevron style rear taillights. Another big bumper is on the back and looking great. Up top a white, white canvas top which moves up and down flawlessly. 17-inch Billet Specialties wheels are on all 4 corners and shining brightly and brand-new tires (less than 200 miles)
        Interior
        As we drop the top and swing the doors we are greeted with more turquoise and white two tone, which interplays on the door panels and split front bench seat and full rear bench. For the seat's turquoise inserts and white bolsters and some white buttons, all smooth and nearly perfect, float in a sea of turquoise carpeting, covered and protected by light blue rubber Chevrolet badged floor mats. A white rally tilting column steering wheel with a drilled chromed center front the original configured deep circle instrument adorned dash. These instruments are now blue LED Dakota digital readout instruments. Some shiny aluminum horizontal ribbing is in the center breaking up some of the turquoise and a retro radio with blue tooth, 6 speakers, sub-woofer and amplifier is in the middle as well as an A/C unit hanging below. For the remainder of the interior more turquoise and white panels and a beautiful clean white tonneau cover for the top are seen and enjoyed.
        Drivetrain
        The new blue mill sits in a new engine bay, all perfectly restored and now a 350 LT-1 sporting fuel injection, and a 4L60E 4-speed automatic on back. Nicely done under this hood.  Recent new radiator and fan along with new chrome master cylinder and disc brakes added to the rear (already disc on front)

          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I  <br> honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a <br>  transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for <br> the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals <br>who can help me learn
          programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to  <br>  enroll by a former
          student of theirs  <br>  who can only say wonderful things  <br>  about the program.
          The entire   <br> curriculum and staff did not   <br> disappoint. They were very
          hands-on  <br>  and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in   <br> particular, was outstanding. It took  <br>  my learning to the
          next level in a way  <br>  that no tutorial could ever have. In  <br>  fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during   <br> interviews as an example of my   <br> developent
          experience. It certainly   <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack  <br> 
          developer after receiving multiple <br>  offers. 100% recommend! ”
